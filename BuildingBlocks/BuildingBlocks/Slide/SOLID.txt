SOLID

S - Single Responsibility Principle

a module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor
--> solutions: separate big class to many small

O - Opened-Closed Principle

a class should be open to upgrade and close to change
--> solutions:
- separate class -> each class do 1 function
- class/module should implement interface (interface play a contract roll)

L - Liskov Substitution
